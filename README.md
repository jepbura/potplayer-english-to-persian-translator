## What is EnToFa?

In the normal mode, **Potplayer** can simultaneously translate all the subtitles and, for individual words, if you click on the word, it will open the word's translation in your browser, which may take a considerable amount of time. However, with **EnToFa**, which is a Python code, it translates words from English to Persian instantly. This version is only available for Windows.

## Installation Windows

After installing `Python` and `pip`, you only need to install `EnToFa` by running the following command:

```bash
	pip install EnToFa
```

That's it!
